# What makes a song successful enough to be featured on the Billboard Hot 100? 

## About This Project

This project is part of my Hyper Island Python Course. I developed a music analytics project combining 25 years of Billboard Hot 100 data with Spotify's Track Audio data. The project consists of an interactive dashboard and an in-depth analysis exploring historical music trends and audio characteristics to understand what makes a song successful enough to be featured on the Billboard Hot 100.

## Data Sources

- **Billboard data**: Historical chart data from the Billboard Hot 100.
- **Spotify data**: Artist information and audio features for tracks available on Spotify.

This exploratory analysis examines 24 years of Billboard chart and Spotify data to identify common factors among Billboard-worthy songs.   

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Executive Summary

Key findings indicate that charting songs consistently share a similar audio profile. These songs typically feature lyrics and are well-suited for dancing, with a sound that is often described as happy, cheerful, or euphoric. They also have an energetic, fast, loud, and noisy quality, with subtle acoustic elements. On average, these songs have a tempo of 122 beats per minute (BPM). Additionally, approximately 33% of these songs are in a major key, with the majority composed in C#/Db.

This audio profile have remained stable over time, with no significant differences observed year-over-year or between the top 10% of songs and the remainder of the dataset. This consistency suggests that broad adherence to this specific audio profile is a key driver of chart success.

Trend analysis reveals a shift in song patterns over time. Song duration and album-exclusive tracks have decreased in popularity, while singles and explicit content have seen increasing success on the charts. These trends indicates an evolution in listener preferences toward shorter, standalone songs that favor explicit content over the traditional album format with clean lyrics.

Analysis of artist data from Spotify, including follower counts and popularity scores, reveals only weak correlations with chart ranking performance. Although an artist's visibility likely contributes to songs being featured on charts, the data suggests that artist popularity plays a negligible role in determining overall chart rankings.

The likelihood of continued success after a song is featured once is high, with 43% of charted songs appearing more than 11 times, exceeding the the average number of Billboard features. This suggests that initial chart success creates a self-reinforcing effect, where listeners may be more inclined to listen to songs they recognize from previous chart appearances, thus contributing to their sustained success.

In summary, Billboard-worthy songs are defined by a distinct audio profile that resonate with a broad range of listeners, along with adherence to the increasing trend of shorter, explicit singles. Once a song becomes successful, it's likely to see continued success on the charts.
