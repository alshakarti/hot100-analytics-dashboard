# What makes a song successful enough to be featured on the Billboard Hot 100? 

### About this project

This project is part of my Hyper Island Python Course. I developed a music analytics project combining 25 years of Billboard Hot 100 data with Spotify's Track Audio data. The project consists of an interactive dashboard and an in-depth analysis exploring historical music trends and audio characteristics to understand what makes a song successful enough to be featured on the Billboard Hot 100.

### Data sources

- **Billboard data**: Historical chart data from the Billboard Hot 100.
- **Spotify data**: Artist information and audio features for tracks available on Spotify.
